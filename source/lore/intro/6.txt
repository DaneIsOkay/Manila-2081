Decades prior to the Eurasia-Pacific Skirmishes, the major superpowers of the world were embroiled in an arms race that resulted into rapid technological advancements. Already pre-existing tensions between nations and superpowers worsened as they grew in strength. The global superpowers, USA, Russia, China, together with the EU (which now barely counts as a superpower), extended their reach and influence on weaker countries and had countless conflicts with each other. Before things could escalate into a third world war and mutually assured destruction, however, they had decided to avoid direct confrontations and use other countries instead as puppets to compete for hegemony. 

As of now, the USA controls the entire North and South American continent as well as certain countries and territories around the world. China, on the other hand, controls the whole of Asia except for certain nations in South and Southeast Asia, however it also controls the South China Sea. Russia now controls its original territory together with other states that once formed the USSR as well as North Korea while the EU fully controls Europe (UK returned while Greenland and Iceland joined eventually) and most of Oceania. Outside of these superpowers, the African continent has devolved into chaos. Other nations, regardless whether they are puppets or vassals of the superpowers, have had many conflicts that may have either been orchestrated by the superpowers or due to the disruption of social order caused by the rise of technology and magic that weaker governments can no longer control. These conflicts eventually escalated into the Eurasia-Pacific Skirmishes
