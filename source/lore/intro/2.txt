Birañoso was an army general during the 2063 Eurasia-Pacific Skirmishes. He led the forces that fended off the invading army of the then-newly established pirate nation of The Republic of Siam. Shortly after his death in 2077, Birañoso’s shield was obtained by The Tondo Dome Association for tournament use. The shield is currently on loan from the Philippine Army to the association for a period of ten (10) years.
