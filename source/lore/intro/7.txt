The advent of magic as an art has led to many changes across the world. One aspect of magic, however, stems from the religious faith of its wielder. This has caused many religions to wield considerable power and influence transcending borders and nationality that even the four major superpowers dare not overlook. The most powerful of all these religious factions is the Holy Catholic Church. Other religions second only to the Church are Islam and Buddhism, however, their potentials are untapped as they are not unified under a central power and are divided into different sects. The Holy Church has almost complete religious control in the Philippines as other religious factions have almost no say in the government.
