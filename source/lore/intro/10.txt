The Disney Commonwealth was established in 2052 as a semi-autonomous nation with artificially constructed territories in the middle of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Their sovereignty over the theme park and film industries remain uncontested, with one of the primary oligarchs of Hollywood being part of the Disney social elite.

Having moved into the arms business (as a means to “promote world peace”), they have designed their equipment around intellectual property assets from a variety of their children companies. One of these is the AEX, which is designed after the Black Panther suit, a proprietary piece of then-fictional technology that is owned by the Marvel company. This suit functions so that the wearer still sustains damage, but cannot get fatally wounded as a result of any attacks. It is also widely used in its more extreme theme parks to preserve the lives of its guests.

They have some of the highest tariffs on tourism in the world per year.
