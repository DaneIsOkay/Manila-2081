Some spells in the Indigene Faction of T3D are given westernized (or, at least, altered) nomenclature. For instance, while the Ifugao people commonly refer to one life-steal spell as “Ang Hawak ni Tagbayan,” the Tondo Dome Association have opted to name it “The Touch of Ereshkigal” after a Sumerian deity for marketing purposes.

Most spells are also derived from pseudo-faiths and pseudo-magic, but the indigenous people attribute such spells to a non-traditional and non-religious set of deities; they generally give no attention to non-tribal dissenters.
