After the vice president of Siam was assassinated in 2053 (an act alleged by many to have been orchestrated by the Thailand government), much blame was pinned on the Philippines. This was after it was discovered that the person who carried out the assassination was a Filipino national that served as a former first lieutenant in the Philippine Army. Pedro Esquinita was publicly executed that same year by the Siam Republic after he was tried and convicted of his charges, leaving behind a widow, Mercedes el Caballo-Esquinita, and a sixteen year-old son, Juan el Caballo-Esquinita (whom sources say has dropped his father’s name). 

However, tensions still continued to rise between Siam and the Philippines along with those of their allies for the next four years, transpiring in a set of skirmishes that lasted from 2057 to 2063. This is now known as the Eurasia-Pacific Skirmishes (or, as some Filipinos call it, “World War Two Point Five''). It must be noted, however, that the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China claim to have remained “neutral” in these skirmishes, having extended no apparent support to either side of the fence.
