The Eurasia-Pacific Skirmishes was a near loss for the Philippines, which turned the tide only after Siam forces had already invaded pieces of land along the coasts of Ilocos. 

Luckily, Professor Frederico Salazar of the University of the Philippines Dilimanâ€™s National Institute of Physics discovered a Nobel award-winning discovery in the field of physics (specifically in photonics and optics) that outlines the manipulation of plasma speed and light speed in a portable manner, along with their applications in military equipment. This led to the creation of the first prototype of the Beamsplitter, a modern standard-issue semi-automatic plasma rifle employed by the soldiers of the Philippine Army.
