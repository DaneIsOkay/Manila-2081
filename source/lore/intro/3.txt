The Republic of Siam originally began as a counter-movement to the regime of the royal family of Thailand in late 2020. After the nation’s establishment in the year 2025 by a group of oligarchic revolutionaries in the southern part of the region (then only called The Gulf of Siam), their military strength exploded in both number and raw might along with their spheres of influence in the Eurasian belt.

This is supported by the fact that both China, the USA, and Russia have begun creating vassal states in African, East European, and Asian continents to expand their respective influences in each region
