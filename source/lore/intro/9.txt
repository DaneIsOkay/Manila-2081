In order to avoid overt casualties in the field, the Tondo Dome Association requires each and every champion to wear an AEX (or Anti-Everything eXosuit) which automatically assesses whether a hit is significantly fatal or not, and to what extent the expected damage must be absorbed in order to avoid such chances from occurring. This design was commissioned by TDA from the Disney Commonwealth, which has now apparently extended its reach to the arms business.
