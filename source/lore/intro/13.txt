Protestant and non-Catholic sects of the Christian ideology are generally considered as heretics of the faith. This usually results in their getting less faith power than the Catholics of the Religious class. They do, however, have more potent use of technology. This is how the rest of the 0.7% of the religious class thrive. While a majority of them are particularly affluent members of their respective sects, further potential-tapping for prospective champions is still required in order to grow their numbers within the TDA. This is not realistic currently, however, since funding is generally limited for non-Catholics due to sponsorship biases within the Philippines.
